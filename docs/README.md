# 3Lens Documentation

> The render introspection OS for three.js — deep causal analysis, not just metrics.

## Overview

3Lens is a comprehensive debugging and introspection toolkit for [three.js](https://threejs.org/) applications. Unlike simple metrics panels, 3Lens is built on 5 foundational primitives that enable deep causal analysis:

1. **Capture** — Authoritative event stream (render events, resource lifecycle)
2. **Model** — Unified typed dependency graph (entities + relationships)
3. **Query** — Tools query the model, not the renderer directly
4. **Visualize** — Views are projections of queries
5. **Act + Verify** — Actions produce events, verification shows diffs

## Key Features

### 🔍 Deep Introspection
- Entity graph browser with namespaced IDs
- Blame navigator for attribution chains
- Resource lifecycle tracking

### ⚡ Performance Analysis
- GPU/CPU attribution with weighted blame chains
- Per-entity cost breakdown
- Data fidelity labels (EXACT/ESTIMATED/UNAVAILABLE)

### 🔧 Trace-Based Debugging
- Capture and replay sessions
- Offline diff/regression analysis
- CI integration for automated testing

### 🏢 Multi-Context Support
- Multiple renderers, scenes, cameras
- Per-context and aggregated queries
- Dynamic context registration

## Quick Links

- **[Guides](/guide/)** — How-to guides

## Getting Started

Install 3Lens using the main package:

```bash
npm install @3lens/devtools
# or
pnpm add @3lens/devtools
# or
yarn add @3lens/devtools
```

### Basic Setup

```typescript
import { createLens, manualHost, uiOverlay } from "@3lens/devtools";

const lens = createLens({
  ui: uiOverlay(),
  addons: ["inspector", "perf", "memory"],
});

lens.registerContext({
  id: "main",
  host: manualHost({ renderer, scene, camera }),
});

lens.attach();
```

### Framework Integration

3Lens provides framework-specific packages for seamless integration:

- **React / React Three Fiber**: `@3lens/devtools/r3f`
- **Vue / TresJS**: `@3lens/devtools/tres`
- **Angular**: `@3lens/devtools/angular`
- **Svelte**: `@3lens/devtools/svelte`

See the [Framework Guides](/guide/) for detailed setup instructions.

### Troubleshooting

If something isn't working, use `lens.doctor()` to diagnose issues:

```typescript
const report = lens.doctor();
console.log(report.actionable_fixes);
```

The doctor report will tell you:
- What contexts were found
- Which hooks are active
- What capabilities are available
- Actionable fixes for common issues
